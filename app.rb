  <h1>Everybody Talks </h1>
  <h2>By The Neon Trees</h2>
  <h3>
  Hey, baby, won't you look my way? <br>
  I can be your new addiction <br>
  Hey, baby, what you gotta say? <br>
  All you're giving me is fiction <br>

  I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time <br>
  I found out that everybody talks <br>
  Everybody talks, everybody talks <br>

  It started with a whisper <br>
  And that was when I kissed her <br>
  And then she made my lips hurt <br>
  I can hear the chitchat <br>
  Take me to your love shack <br>
  Mamas always gotta backtrack <br>
  When everybody talks back <br>
   <br>
  Hey honey you could be my drug <br>
  You could be my new prescription <br>
  Too much could be an overdose <br>
  All this trash talk make me itching <br>
   <br>
  Oh my my shit <br>
  Everybody talks, everybody talks <br>
  Everybody talks too much <br>
   <br>
  It started with a whisper <br>
  And that was when I kissed her <br>
  And then she made my lips hurt <br>
  I can hear the chitchat <br>
  Take me to your love shack <br>
  Mamas always gotta backtrack <br>
  When everybody talks back <br>
   <br>
  Never thought I'd live to see the day <br>
  When everybody's words got in the way <br>
   <br>
  Hey sugar show me all your love <br>
  All you're giving me is friction <br>
  Hey sugar what you gotta say? <br>
   <br>
  It started with a whisper <br>
  And that was when I kissed her <br>
  And then she made my lips hurt <br>
  I can hear the chitchat <br>
  Take me to your love shack <br>
  Mamas always gotta backtrack <br>
  When everybody talks back <br>
   <br>
  Everybody talks <br>
  Everybody talks <br>
  Everybody talks <br>
  Everybody talks <br>
  Everybody talks <br>
  Everybody talks... back <br>
   <br>
  It started with a whisper  <br>
  (everybody talks, everybody talks) <br>
  And that was when I kissed her  <br>
  (everybody talks, everybody talks) <br>
   <br>
  Everybody talks <br>
  Everybody talks... back <br>
